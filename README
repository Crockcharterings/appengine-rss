Simple RSS/Atom aggregator and reader for Google AppEngine (Python)

... because Google Reader died, then the Old Reader went down, so I manned up
and wrote my own. Obviously, my free AppEngine bandwidth is not enough for
more than a handful of users, so I encourage those interested to simply
deploy their own. Enjoy!

It should mostly work out of the box. Follow these steps:

1. Download it
2. Include the following:
    Bootstrap:
        incl/bootstrap.3.rc1/css/bootstrap.min.css
        incl/bootstrap.3.rc1/js/bootstrap.min.js
    Glyphicons (for Bootstrap):
        incl/glyphicons/css/bootstrap-glyphicons.css
        incl/glyphicons/fonts/glyphiconshalflings-regular.eot
        incl/glyphicons/fonts/glyphiconshalflings-regular.otf
        incl/glyphicons/fonts/glyphiconshalflings-regular.svg
        incl/glyphicons/fonts/glyphiconshalflings-regular.ttf
        incl/glyphicons/fonts/glyphiconshalflings-regular.woff
2. On line 1 of app.yaml, put your application identifier
3. Deploy to AppEngine
4. Go to [your identifier].appspot.com

Authentication type can be set through AppEngine (Google, Google Apps, or OpenID)

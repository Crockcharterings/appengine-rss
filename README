Simple RSS aggregator and reader for Google AppEngine (Python)

... because Google Reader died, then the Old Reader went down, so I manned up
and wrote my own. Obviously, my free AppEngine bandwidth is not enough for
more than a handful of users, so I encourage those interested to simply
deploy their own. Enjoy!

It should mostly work out of the box. Follow these steps:

1. Download it
2. On line 1 of app.yaml, put your application identifier
3. Deploy to AppEngine
4. Go to [your identifier].appspot.com
